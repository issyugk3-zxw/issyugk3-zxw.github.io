I am currently a senior undergraduate student at **Zhejiang University of Technology**, majoring in **Software Engineering**.  

🔜 I will soon be joining **Nakato Lab** at the **Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (IQB), The University of Tokyo**, as a master's student in the **Department of Computational Biomedical Science (CBMS), Graduate School of Frontier Sciences**. I will be conducting research under the supervision of **Professor Ryuichiro Nakato**.  

## 🔬 Research Interests  
My research interests lie at the intersection of **Machine Learning 🤖, Bioinformatics & Computational Biology 🧬, and Data Mining & Visualization 📊**.  

Throughout my undergraduate years, thanks to Professor Kecheng Zheng, I was very lucky to have the chance to participate in research projects on Computer Networks.
