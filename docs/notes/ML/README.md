As a student majored in software engineering, the school of mine did not offer many courses about this topic(except an introduction course). I have to learn it all by myself, and I usually focused on modern deep learning structures. Thus, I do not know the history, nor the development of traditional methods. And don't even mention what advantages/disadvantages they got.

Therefore, as my research interests gradually require stronger foundational theories, I decided to learn it all over and take some notes here. 

I would be grateful if anyone read this could offer me some advice. 

Here are the links to the notes:

## Traditional Learning

- [2.Frequentist-view Methods](/ML/sa39a9gm/)
## Modern Deep Learning
